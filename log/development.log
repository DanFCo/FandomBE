Six years ago, Christine and Greg Clark walked away from their Brisbane home and construction careers to chase their dream of striking it big, 4000km away in the West Australian Goldfields.

The series was the brainchild of veteran producer Paul Monash. Impressed with the success of Britain's monster hit Coronation Street, Monash wanted to import that UK series; however, ABC executives felt that US audiences would not cotton to the thick British accents and kitchen-sink drama. Monash countered with a slightly revamped version of Peyton Place, which had been a wildly popular novel by Grace Metalious and subsequent Hollywood film starring Lana Turner and Diane Varsi. While the book and series centered on the pious, hypocritical behavior of New England residents, the TV series eschewed most of that lasciviousness and told the story of life in a small New England village. In many ways, the TV program resembled a dramatic version of The Andy Griffith Show, featuring a recurring cast of warm, sympathetic characters.</p>"], ["LIMIT", 1]]

They don't know when to stop, and live life to the full—meet the never-a-dull-moment Sakurai family, where nobody holds their feelings back. Returning to serial drama for the first time in five years, Misako Tanaka and the three hyperactive sons provide a story with a heartbeat. Sakurai Harue who has brought up her sons alone after her husband died, is absolutely hopeless at running a household. Her eldest, stickler Tatsuya, does the job in her place while keeping younger brothers Riku, and Junpei firmly in line. The sparks are constantly flying, but that's the way it goes in this home. Tatsuya, a serious-minded advertising agency worker, and his brothers, an easy-going swimming instructor and rather naïve student, are three good-lookers who, along with their useless live-wire of a mother, keep getting into all sorts of scrapes—in love and at work. This is the Sakurai household, where everything hangs loose and everyone always speaks their mind. Tanaka says she really loves this ‘perfect family.' They are sure to win your hearts too! </p>"], ["LIMIT", 1]]

Murphy is determined to find the truth, no matter the risk… even if it means she has to sober up a little.</p>"], ["LIMIT", 1]]

News</b>, previously known as <i>E! News Daily</i> and <i>E! News Live</i>, is the flagship entertainment newscast of the E! network in the United States. Without italics, it is the name of the network's entertainment-news division. The newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reports on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, and some news about the industry in general. The program first aired on September 1, 1991 and was originally hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named <i>E! News Live</i>). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by Jason Kennedy. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), leaving others to question if she would return. But Rancic reassured her fans by releasing a statement saying she had just signed a three-year deal with E! News and Fashion Police. During her leave, her anchoring duties were taken over by Catt Sadler. From 2006 until late 2010, <i>The Daily 10</i>, hosted by Sal Masekela, Catt Sadler, and at one point Debbie Matenopoulos, aired following <i>E! News</i>.</p><p>On September 21, 2010, E! announced the cancellation of <i>The Daily 10</i>. At this time, it was announced that <i>E! News</i> would be expanded to a one-hour format. The expansion became effective beginning on October 25, 2010, making it one of two entertainment news programs to have weekday editions that air in an hour-long format,HLN's <i>Showbiz Tonight</i> being the other. The series also debuted a new news set and began broadcasting in 16:9 high definition, downconverted to 4:3 letterbox (with pillarboxing for 4:3 SD video) on the channel's primary SD feed. Some talent previously featured on <i>The Daily 10</i>, including Catt Sadler, Clinton Sparks and Robbie Laughlin, were integrated into <i>E!

Besides their successful musical careers, they are also notable for branching out into acting. Kid 'n Play had their own NBC Saturday morning cartoon, <i>Kid 'n Play</i>, for one season from 1990 to 1991. On the show, Kid 'n Play were regressed to teenagers, but their recording careers remained intact, as did their comic personas. The real Kid 'n Play appeared in live-action wraparounds of the cartoons, but voice actors (again including close friend, Martin Lawrence) performed in the animated portions of the show. The show stressed positive role models, teaching kids how to get along and stay out of trouble. A 1992 Marvel Comics comic book based on the cartoon lasted nine issues.

So they embark on a road trip through the country's back roads, immersing themselves in local American history and long-standing traditions. In addition to cooking and eating with locals they meet along the way, Patranella and Allen do everything it takes to get the meal on the table -- from spearing bullfrogs to cleaning roadkill and tracking down wild boars. While on the open road, the guys camp, stop at roadside attractions and attend local biker events -- all to achieve their goal of experiencing firsthand why eating and biking are two of America's favorite pastimes.</p>"], ["LIMIT", 1]]
